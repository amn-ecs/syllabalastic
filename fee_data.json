However, importantly this module aims to provide you with teaching experience and valuable transferable skills. The module has no formal lectures, but instead involves you spending time outside university within a local school (primary, secondary or tertiary) for approximately \u00bd day a week for a full semester (10 weeks) supported by tutorials at university. During the placements, you will initially observe teaching but gradually become more involved in the classroom, ultimately carrying out a special project with pupils. As you will be acting as a role model within a local school and due to the limited number of placements, there is an interview process. This also serves to match you with an appropriate school and teacher, based on your preferences and what you want to get from the module.<br><br>The module is reliant on placements being secured in local primary, secondary schools or tertiary colleges, which limits the number of students that this module can be made available to. A cap of about 20 students is a reasonable estimate. It is therefore important to select students based on an application form and interview process to assess their suitability for the module and to act as representatives of the University. A Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check is also necessary before placements can commence, therefore participation on this module cannot be guaranteed to all students that pass the interview<\/p><\/span>",

        "learningoutcomes": "<span><p>Prestressed concrete is becoming increasingly important in modern structural engineering because it leads to significant improvements in design economy. During this course you will learn how to design prestressed concrete beams for bridges and for use in post-tensioned flat slab buildings. Some of the most exciting structures in civil engineering, such as cable-stayed bridges utilise thin-walled structures to maximise stiffness and minimise self-weight. You will learn the theory of buckling of these structures and you will learn how to apply this theory to the design of bridges. Linear-elastic FE analysis of complex reinforced concrete structures can provide unsafe solutions; as occurred during the design of the Sleipner Oil Platform which sunk at the cost of several hundred million dollars. This disaster could have been avoided if the designers had used the strut and tie method during the design. You will learn how to use this advanced technique to design complex reinforced concrete structures subjected to concentrated loads. You will learn how to formulate a range of the most common forms of S&amp;T models and you will apply these to case-studies such as long-span bridges, through to smaller scale structures such as the design of post-tensioning anchors for buildings. Many structures are considered unsatisfactory because they suffer from cracking. You will learn how to predict and control cracking for reinforced concrete structures and you will consider how movements can be accommodated to prevent cracking. Most steel beams used in bridges and buildings act compositely with the supported reinforced concrete slabs. In this module will you will learn how to design these steel-concrete composite beams using a range of design examples taken from bridges and multi-storey buildings.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/span>",

        "introduction": "<span><p>Fluid Mechanics is based on the fundamental laws which define the general fluid motion. The governing equations of fluid mechanics were written in the 19th century, but they were so difficult that no one could solve them for a practically relevant situation, so they were useless in this sense. To meet the demands of the 19th-century industrial revolution the phenomenological approach (called hydraulics) was developed. <br><br>Nowadays, new analytical and numerical methods were developed which are capable of solving the equations of fluid mechanics, while some classical industries for which the 19th-century empirical relations were established are becoming redundant (or are moving from the UK). The modern industry is interested in new processes happening either too quickly or in a very small scale or at very high temperatures or at very nasty chemical environments. While improvements to the 19th-century technologies were possible on the basis of the common sense; the new technologies require the knowledge of fluid flow behaviour under the conditions beyond our everyday experience. Old phenomenological formulae are not relevant, and the new models are to be built up on the basis of the fundamental physical laws. Experimental measurements of the new phenomenological relations are required but such measurements are either impossible or at least expensive to undertake for every geometry change. It is more desirable to solve the equations for all interesting configurations. <br><br>SESM3004 is the third course of Fluid Mechanics for the ME students. The students learn the basic governing equations in SESM2007. The idea for the SESM3004 is to apply these equations to several particular problems, such as steady and non-steady plane-parallel flows, water waves, convection, capillary flows and sound waves, and to learn the main concepts of the hydrodynamic instability and transition to turbulence. The students will learn the current hydrodynamic description of some technological processes which involve fluid flows and in addition an attention will be paid to the concept of physical modelling required for understanding and consequent improvement of fluid flow aspects of existent applications.<\/p><\/span>",

In geology, the module provides a general introduction with an emphasis on understanding its importance to ground construction.  The course provides an introduction to the main geological processes and a broad appreciation of geohazards and geotechnical risks, of the formation and variability of geotechnical materials, and the importance of groundwater.  Fundamental soil and rock properties are introduced in the context of basic soil mechanics.<br><br>In computer methods, the students are introduced to the basic ideas of computer programming using the graphical SCRATCH platform. More formal procedural programming techniques are then developed using MATLAB. As a secondary aim - and to provide programming exercises with which to motivate the syntactic development - the students will be introduced to simple numerical methods (root finding and basic data processing).<br><br>Learning outcomes are as follows:<br><br>Having successfully completed the module, you will be able to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of: <br><br>\u2022\tlinear and non-linear regression<br>\u2022\tnumerical solution of simple equations<br>\u2022\tthe importance of pH buffering capacity in biological systems<br>\u2022\tchemical principles behind solubility, precipitation, rate kinetics and enthalpy<br>\u2022\teffective stress and Mohr circles<br>\u2022\tgeohazards and geotechnical risks<br>\u2022\tgeological materials, their origins, distribution and uses<br>\u2022\tgroundwater<br>\u2022\tplate tectonics and the structure of the Earth<br>\u2022\tthe importance of geology to civil engineering<br><\/p><\/span>",

The aim is to develop the skills that all masters students need to undertake their research projects later in the course and in life.  The module begins with a look at identifying key information in text and how to strip away unnecessary words.  This is followed by an examination of the roles of tables and figures in scientific papers and how to make best use of restricted publishing space, emphasising what must be included and what can be assumed.    A further session introduces the assessment. You will be required to write a thorough and critical literature review of a topic relevant to your degree title.<\/p><\/span>",

The concept of a waste management hierarchy is introduced and practical ways in which it might be implemented are discussed These include waste minimisation, reuse, recycling and recovery as practical alternatives to disposal techniques. The technology and management strategies associated with such schemes are dealt with in detail and include: the design and operation of materials reclamation facilities; composting and anaerobic digestion; and thermal treatment processes. How the selection of these options is influenced by legislative issues is developed in a parallel manner. The module also considers planning and economic issues associated with the industry in the UK which leads on to a detailed examination of the most dominant current practice of landfill as a final disposal option. In this part of the course emphasis is placed on the design and engineering of landfill so as to maximise recovery options and negate environmental damage. The module may include a field trip to a waste management facility if student numbers allow this; if not visual material will be used to familiarise students with details of typical plant and installations.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/span>",

Another aim is to introduce the basic concepts associated with the behaviour of sound and applications of acoustics in the underwater environment. Underwater Acoustics 1 will incorporate proofs of basic relevant physics and describe the range of environments and applications. Though much of the work relates to the ocean environment, sections on non-linear and biomedical ultrasonics are also included. It is important that the student grasp the basic physics underlying the mathematical proofs, in preparation for Underwater Acoustics 2.<\/p>\n<p>The student should feel comfortable with the underlying physical processes governing sound and ultrasound in liquids, and be able as a consequence to explore similarities between sound in the ocean and ultrasound in the body, and extrapolate to new circumstances through discussion. By the end of the course the class should also have gained the skill of critically assessing the way material is simplified in order to present a coherent story (lecture course, journal paper, web page) to the intended audience, and the limitations this imposes upon the material.<\/p><\/span>",

Because the module aims to give a grounding across a range of core scientific and clinical aspects of cochlear implantation, the focus will be more on application to adults than application to children, although students will learn about key issues relating to candidacy and outcomes in the paediatric population.<br><br>Week one will comprise daily lecture series on the nature of severe and profound deafness, and cochlear implant design, candidacy, tuning and monitoring methods. Formative online tests will be available to support learning. The week will provide a broad overview of core scientific and clinical aspects of cochlear implantation that will form the basis of on-going research and clinical practice. <br><br>In weeks two and three facilitated and non-facilitated group work in a small group setting will be used to work on a specialist topic that requires development of a research-baseed protocol in a current aspect of cochlear implant science, culminating in a summative group assignment and summative group presentation. Chosen topics will be based on current areas in cochlear implantation which are at the cutting edge of knowledge and where current knowledge is incomplete or controversial. <br><br>A facilitated group observation session will be arranged during the module; this will link with a summative individual assessment but precise timing will be subject to availability. The focus will be on learning outcomes related to the need to become an independent reflective practitioner. The individual assignment will require the student to analyse the clinical session from varying perspective, including professional, ethical, clinical and scientific aspects.<\/p><\/span>",

The teaching outlook is based on a premise that the fundamental characteristic of current design practice is the effective collaboration of specialists that produce intelligent designs by integrating the technical, aesthetic, social and economic needs of a project (Spence R et al 2001 - Interdisciplinary education for design professionals \u2013 Gann D &amp; Salter.  Spence R, Macmillan S, Kirby P, 2001.  Interdisciplinary Design in Practice. Thomas Telford, London).<br><br>The module compliments previous knowledge in mathematics, statics, structural analysis, and ground engineering.  It will cover advanced areas of building construction in relation to structural theory, building ventilation and thermal performance, mechanical services for low energy design, fire engineering, acoustics and building fa\u00e7ade technologies.  To illustrate interdisciplinary design practice the course will use case studies taken from many building sectors such as schools, hospitals, research laboratories, commercial buildings (accommodation, offices and mixed-use developments), public buildings (museums &amp; libraries), tall buildings and long-span lightweight structures (canopies, sports stadia).<br><br>Learning outcomes in detail are as follows:<br><br>1.\tInterdisciplinary design of construction systems<br>1.1\tAwareness of the main architectural and technical drivers influencing the concept design of construction systems<br>1.2\tKnowing how the main engineering disciplines collaborate on the schematic and detailed design of buildings. <br>1.3\tAbility to develop structural designs based on building construction systems. <br>2.\tBuilding Environmental Control<br>2.1\tAwareness of the human needs that drive environmental control systems for buildings.<br>2.2\tUnderstanding the principles of passive design for environmental control of buildings<br>2.3\tKnowing which building services systems to select for different spaces and environmental conditions <br>2.4\tAbility to pre-size building services plant and interpret schematics for distribution networks. <br>3.\tFire Engineering<br>3.1\tAwareness of the statutory approach and the engineering approach to dealing with fire.<br>3.2\tKnowing how a fire engineering approach can be used to influence the layout and construction of buildings.<br>3.3\tAbility to analyse structures for fire engineering performance. <br>4.\tBuilding Acoustics<br>4.1\tAwareness of the nature of sound and how acoustic &amp; vibration performance is assessed in buildings<br>4.2\tKnowing how to design buildings to optimise acoustic performance<br>4.3\tAbility to calculate the acoustic profile of a spatial and construction arrangement.<br>5.\tBuilding Envelope<br>5.1\tAwareness of the main criteria for specifying a building envelope<br>5.2\tKnowing how fa\u00e7ade systems perform.<br>5.3\tAbility to select and detail a fa\u00e7ade system.<br>6.\tBuilding Information Modelling (BIM)<br>6.1\tAwareness of the growing impact of BIM in the collaborative process of project designs<br>6.2\tKnowing how the different elements of design combine, based on a common data model  <br>6.3\tAbility to manipulate data to optimise integrated building design performance through BIM<\/p><\/span>",

        "introduction": "<span><p>The Undergraduate Ambassador Scheme was initially founded to encourage graduates to consider teaching as a career, particularly in shortage subject areas (maths, sciences), and is currently available in other schools within the University of Southampton as well as in some other universities. However, importantly this module aims to provide you with teaching experience and valuable transferable skills. The module has no formal lectures, but instead involves you spending time outside of university within a local school (primary, secondary or tertiary) for approximately \u00bd day a week for a full semester (10 weeks) supported by tutorials at university. During the placements, you will initially observe teaching but gradually become more involved in the classroom, ultimately carrying out a special project with pupils. As you will be acting as a role model within a local schools and due to the limited number of placements, there is an interview process. This also serves to match you up with an appropriate school and teacher based on your preferences and what you want to get out of the module.<\/p>\n<p>The module is reliant on placements being secured in local primary, secondary schools or tertiary colleges, which limits the number of students that this module can be made available to. A cap of about 20 students is a reasonable estimate. It is therefore important to select students based on an application form and interview process to assess their suitability for the module and to act as representatives of the University. A Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check is also necessary before placements can commence, therefore participation on this module cannot be guaranteed to all students that pass the interview.<\/p><\/span>",

By completing this module an acoustical engineering student will appreciate how simple mechanisms forming a complex machine can be the source of vibration and a mechanical student can appreciate the response of a machine to such excitations.<br><br>The course assumes knowledge of elementary vector algebra and the concepts of time and partial derivatives. An elementary Physics course covering Newton's laws or course(s) on Statics and Dynamics can be very helpful in understanding the material covered as the course reviews these topics and then applies them to more complex problems. There will be equal emphasis placed on gaining both analytical understanding and insight\/intuition on the subject. The material presented in the lectures will emphasize the analytical component of the subject, while with the assignment (through coding and modelling) and the experimental laboratory work will encourage students to see beyond equations. This module will provide a pre-requisite understanding for more advanced topics such as vibration measurement and analysis with numerical tools such as Finite Element Method Analysis and will prepare the students for automotive modules.<\/p><\/span>",

        "learningoutcomes": "<span><p>The overall aim of the module is to provide an integrated understanding of the process of design and construction of civil engineering structures and buildings, incorporating the creative design process, graphical communication, materials science, quantitative structural design and implementation of the construction process (the latter including land surveying, setting out, planning, construction management and practical site operations). At the end of the module, students should have experienced the distinct design and construction process as is commonly applied in the civil engineering industry and gained an appreciation of the roles and responsibilities of the main parties involved \u2013 architect, engineer and construction manager. The module complements others in the first year of the programme, such as Mechanics, Structures and Materials and Civil and Environmental Engineering Fundamentals that cover the basic knowledge, theory and analytical tools that inform the design and construction process overall.<br><br>The module comprises a number of elements \u2013 creative design, graphics, materials science, surveying, quantitative design and construction. In creative design, through an overview of the history of engineering and architecture students will be introduced to the way in which the design of structures has developed over time, referring constantly to cultural and technological developments. The course covers seminal structures, designers and movements from the classical period to the Modern Movement. In graphics, students develop a range of graphical skills to communicate ideas and engineering solutions both formally and informally, including learning the significance of sketching in communicating and developing design solutions and an introduction to orthographic projection. A wide range of graphical techniques are illustrated from industry examples.  AutoCAD is learned through a carefully structured training programme designed to prepare students for the industry recognised AutoCAD Certified Associate and Professional examinations in June.<br><br>In materials science, students receive a basic understanding of the properties of engineering materials based on fundamental scientific principles, to enable a sound rationale for selection and use of materials in civil engineering. In surveying, students will become conversant with modern surveying and construction techniques and develop surveying and setting out skills based on practical tasks undertaken around the campus. These skills will then be applied as a very important element of the construction of structures during the Constructionarium.<\/p>\n<p>The Constructionarium itself is a week-long residential field course activity that will test the awareness and knowledge of engineering processes in solving a series of practical construction tasks using the common civil engineering materials, steel, timber and reinforced concrete. Teamworking and communication skills will also be tested during this week.<\/p>\n<p>In a final exercise undertaken in Semester 2 in parallel with the Constructionarium, students link knowledge gained in the Mechanics, Structures and Materials module on the theoretical behaviour of structures with that gained in materials science and design in this module. This is achieved by undertaking numerical calculations to assess the performance of the Constructionarium structures, through a structural design exercise that includes sketching of load paths and structural  form and understanding of loading, structural stability and structural element behaviour.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p><\/span>",

Please contact the Module Coordinator for further details.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Experimental mechanics\u2019 can be defined as the investigation by  experimental means of the mechanical behaviour of engineering systems  subjected to load. The system can be a structure, a material, soft  matter such as human tissue, a fluid-structure coupling; the list is  practically endless. Implicit in the definition is that some kind of  measurement system is used to capture a quantity that describes the  system\u2019s behaviour. The main attributes conventionally associated with  experimental mechanics are the deformation and the mechanical strain.  These can then be related to a failure parameter by deriving the  stresses from the strains by knowing the material constitutive  relationships. Experimental mechanics approaches that provide a measure  related to the strain are therefore very important design tools. Many of  these techniques have been available for decades but recently have been  gaining popularity because of the advances in computing power and  decreasing hardware costs. More importantly from the design perspective,  the necessity for experimental data to validate numerical models of  systems manufactured from complex nonlinear inhomogeneous materials,  such as fibre reinforced polymer composites, is ever increasing.  Experimental mechanics approaches have much to offer and it is the  purpose of this module to provide an overview of the range of  application and operation of the techniques.<\/p><\/span>",

Drainage systems, natural rivers, pipes and culverts are used to transport water across the natural landscape and through urban areas. Hydraulic modelling software (HEC RAS) will be used to simulate the movement of the flood hydrographs through natural and man made channels, including open channels, culverts, pipes, bridges, lakes etc. Where a flooding problem is identified, students will be shown how to develop a series of engineering responses to reduce flood risk.

You should also consider and apply the wider aspects of the engineering problem of the project by covering (i) social, (ii) economic and\/or environmental issues related to the subject matter of the project. <br><br>Working in groups you will negotiate with your 'client', be it your supervisor or an external sponsor, develop your team working, plan your project, present your work through meetings with your supervisor and assessors, report writing and oral presentations. At all times, you will monitor your progress as a team to ensure you are achieving the objectives set while ensuring quality of output.<\/p>\n<p>You should consult the section \"Group Project\" in the Part IV coursebook for full details regarding conducting the project, meetings, forms required and important deadline dates.<\/p><\/span>",

        "learningoutcomes": "<span><p>The module will introduce you to a number of key statistical concepts and data presentation formats.  The module begins with an examination of a variety of data types using scales of measurements to define the nature and properties of data you are likely to encounter.  Emphasis is placed on distinguishing between population parameters and sample statistics and to explore the nature of distributions.  This is aided via the introduction of a powerful graphics package, a component part of SPSS; a dedicated statistical software.  You will become familiar with the concept of central tendancy and the measurement of variation and how these may be presented graphically.  Emphasis is placed on information transfer to aid in the construction of presentations, essays, reports and dissertation.  Central to the enture module is your exposure of to SPSS in which you will become familiar.  However, in addition to computer technology the module aims at improving your skills in the use of hand calculator for use in laboratory and the field applications.  A significant portion of the module is given to developing your understanding of a variety of common statistical procedures including establishing the presence and strength of a realtionship between variables and standard approaches for determing if significant differences exist between groups within a variety of experimental designs.  Central to this is the concept of hypotheses testing.  The overall aim of the module is to empower you with the ability to understand statistical nomenclature in the literature and to carry out statistical analysis and data presentation for use throughout your undergraduate career and beyond.<\/p><\/span>",

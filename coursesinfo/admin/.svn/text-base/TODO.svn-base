    finish the changes section. (needs a nicer layout)

I don't think this are on the critical path (but they are still important)

    make some validation happen (eg. frequency set with no type etc.)
    make it show BANNER title, semester & credits once we get that hook up done
    make it save changes in a smart way
    make it display changes
    strip non 8 char courses from the DB!

These are what I think is needed for non-confirmed syllabuses

    allow you to create non-coded syllabus for provisional courses.



Longer term:

    changes probably want a requires-sign-off flag so they can be reviewed, unless minor is set.
